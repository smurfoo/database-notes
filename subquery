-- SubQueries
--A query inside another statement(query, insert, update, delete)
--A subquery is a full query that can be executed and tested on it's own 
--Can usually be used anywhere a value is used
--join-Select all the staff names that area a instructor
select firstname , lastname from staff
inner join position on position.positionId = staff.positionid
where positiondescription = 'dean'
select firstname,lastname from staff
where positionId = (Select PositionID from position where PositionDescription = 'Dean')

--join-- Select studentID and names of students that have made payments
select distinct student.studentId'ID', firstname + ' ' + lastname 'Student Name' from student
inner join payment on payment.StudentID = student.StudentID
--A subquery
select studentid,firstname,lastname from student
where studentid in (select studentid from payment)
--does not work, because the subquery returns more than one value
--If the subquery returns more than one value, you must use IN
select studentid,firstname,lastname from student
where studentid in (select studentid from payment)
--studentid, names of student that have made no payments
-- subquery
select student.studentid,firstname,lastname ,paymentID 
from student
left outer join payment on payment.studentID = student.studentID
where amount is null
-- sub query
select studentid,firstname,lastname from student
where studentid not in (select studentid from payment)

-- How many payments has each and every student made? show student id name and the count
select  student.studentid,firstname,lastname,count(*) 'Count'  
from student
left outer join payment on payment.studentid = student.studentid
group by student.studentid,firstname,lastname
-- Returns counts of 1 when there should be counts of 0
-- Because the outer join returns the students that have no payments and they get counted as 1
select  student.studentid,firstname,lastname,count(paymentID) 'Count'  
from student
left outer join payment on payment.studentid = student.studentid
group by student.studentid,firstname,lastname
-- When using count() with outer joins you must count the PK of the child table. 
-- If the parent has no child records it will be NULL and therefore not counted
