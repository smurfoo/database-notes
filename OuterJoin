Outer join
-- Remember, INNER JOINS only return records that have related records in their child tables

-- Select all the position Descriptions and the names of staff in them
Select positionDescription , firstname, lastname 
from position 
inner join staff on position.PositionId = staff.PositionID
-- We are not returning one position because there are not staff in that position
-- Use outer joins to get ALL the parent records, even if there are no related 
-- child records
-- Left outer joins/ right outer joins
-- In a 2 table join you can use which ever one you want.
--Using a left outer join to get ALL the position descriptions, the staff in them
-- even if they have no staff
Select positionDescription , firstname, lastname 
from staff 
right outer join position on position.PositionId = staff.PositionID
-- Why does this not make sense?
-- This behaves like an inner
Select positionDescription , firstname, lastname 
from position 
right outer join staff on position.PositionId = staff.PositionID

-- For a 2 TABLE outer join the left/right will ALWAYS point to the PARENT table

-- GENERAL RULE - Your outer joins must always point to the data that you want to keep


-- Select ALL the student names , their course ids, and marks
Select firstname + ' ' + lastname 'StudentName', courseid 'CourseID' , mark 'Mark'  
from student
left outer join Registration on student.StudentID = Registration.StudentID 
right outer join Offering on offering.OfferingCode = Registration.OfferingCode
